            <h2 class="welcome">The Avengers</h2>
            <h4 class=centered>
                Marvel's The Avengers[6] (classified under the name Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United
                Kingdom and Ireland),[3][7] or simply The Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on
                the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by
                Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.[N 1] It is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
                (MCU). The film was written and directed by Joss Whedon and features an ensemble cast that
                includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and
                Jeremy Renner as the titular Avengers team, alongside Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie
                Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Nick Fury, director of the spy
                agency S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, and Thor to form a team
                that must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.

                The film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April
                2005. After the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers
                would be released in July 2011. With the signing of Johansson in March 2009, the film was pushed
                back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original
                screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving
                to Cleveland, Ohio, in August and New York City in September. The film was converted to 3D in
                post-production.

                The Avengers premiered on April 11, 2012, at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre and was released in
                the United States on May 4, 2012. The film received positive reviews from critics, as well as
                numerous awards and nominations including Academy Award and BAFTA nominations for achievements
                in visual effects. It set or tied numerous box office records, including the biggest opening
                weekend in the United States and Canada. The Avengers grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide and
                became the third-highest-grossing film of all time, as well as the highest-grossing film of
                2012. It is the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales. In 2017, it was
                featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in Empire magazine's poll of The 100
                Greatest Movies.[8]</h4>

                The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1. The Russo brothers
                came on board to direct in April 2015 and by May, Markus and McFeely had signed on to write the
                script for the film, which drew inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 The Infinity Gauntlet comic
                and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 Infinity comic. In 2016, Marvel shortened the title to Avengers:
                Infinity War. Filming began in January 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County,
                Georgia, with a large cast consisting mostly of actors reprising their roles from previous MCU

                with a direct sequel, Avengers: Endgame. Additional filming took place in Scotland, England, the
                Downtown Atlanta area, and New York City. With an estimated budget in the range of $316–400
                million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.

                Avengers: Infinity War held its world premiere on April 23, 2018 in Los Angeles and was released
                in the United States on April 27, 2018, in IMAX and 3D. The film received praise for the
                performances of the cast (particularly Brolin's) and the emotional weight of the story, as well
                as the visual effects and action sequences. It was the fourth film and the first superhero film
                to gross over $2 billion worldwide, breaking numerous box office records and becoming the
                highest-grossing film of 2018, as well as the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time and in
                the United States and Canada. The film received Academy Award and BAFTA nominations for
                achievements in visual effects. </h4>
