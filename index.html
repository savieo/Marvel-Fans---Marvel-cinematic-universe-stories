        <h1 class="welcome">MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE</h1>
        <p class=centered>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe that is
            centered on a series of superhero films, independently produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters
            that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise has expanded to include comic
            books, short films, television series, and digital series. The shared universe, much like the original
            Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and
            characters. Phil Coulson, portrayed by Clark Gregg, is an original character to the MCU and the only
            character to appear across all its different media.
            The franchise has been commercially successful as a multimedia shared universe, though some critics have
            found that some of its films and television series have suffered in service of the wider universe. It has
            inspired other film and television studios with comic book character adaptation rights to attempt to create
            similar shared universes. The MCU has also been the focus of other media, outside of the shared universe,
            including attractions at various Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, an attraction at Discovery Times Square, a
            Queensland Gallery of Modern Art exhibit, two television specials, guidebooks for each film, multiple tie-in
            video games, and commercials.

            The first film released in the MCU was Iron Man (2008), which began the first phase of films culminating in
            the crossover film Marvel's The Avengers (2012). Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013), and concluded with
            Ant-Man (2015). The MCU is currently in Phase Three, which began with the release of Captain America: Civil
            War (2016) and is set to conclude with Avengers: Endgame (2019). Phase Four will begin with the release of
            Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Marvel Television expanded the universe further, first to network
            television with Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in the 2013–14 television season, followed by online
            streaming with Marvel's Daredevil on Netflix in 2015 and Marvel's Runaways on Hulu in 2017, and then to
            cable television with Marvel's Cloak & Dagger on Freeform in 2018. Marvel Television has also produced the
            digital series Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot, which is a supplement to Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
            Soundtrack albums have been released for all of the films, along with many of the television series, as well
            as the release of compilation albums containing existing music heard in the films. The MCU also includes
            tie-in comics published by Marvel Comics, while Marvel Studios has also produced a series of direct-to-video
            short films and a viral marketing campaign for its films and the universe with the faux news program WHIH
            Newsfront.

        <p class=centered>"It's never been done before and that's kind of the spirit everybody's taking it in. The other
            filmmakers
            aren't used to getting actors from other movies that other filmmakers have cast, certain plot lines that
            are connected or certain locations that are connected, but I think ... everyone was on board for it and
            thinks that it's fun. Primarily because we've always remained consistent saying that the movie that we
            are making comes first. All of the connective tissue, all of that stuff is fun and is going to be very
            important if you want it to be. If the fans want to look further and find connections, then they're there.
            There are a few big ones obviously, that hopefully the mainstream audience will able to follow as well. But
            ...
            the reason that all the filmmakers are on board is that their movies need to stand on their own. They need
            to have
            a fresh vision, a unique tone, and the fact that they can interconnect if you want to follow those
            breadcrumbs is a bonus."
            —Kevin Feige, President of Production for Marvel Studios, on constructing a shared film universe.</p>
